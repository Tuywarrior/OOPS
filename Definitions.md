# OOPS

**smalltalk** is considered as first true object oriented programming language

c++ oops mainly has:
 ** Inheritance,
  Polymorphism,
  Abstraction,
  Encapsulation,**
  
  
  
  
**ADVANTAGES OF OOPS**:
  
   OOPs makes development and maintenance of code easier where as in procedure-oriented programming language it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size          grows.
   
   OOPs provides data hiding unlike procedural programming languages.
   
   OOPs provide ability to simulate real world event much more effectively.
  
  
  
What is an **object**?

  A real world entity that has state and behavior is called an object.Object can be considered as an intance of a class.Its a runtime entity and is created at runtime.



What is a **Class**?

  A class is a user defined data type which has data members and functions.It is basically a blueprint of an object and is the main building block of OOPS.Its a logical entity. 
  
  
  
What is a **constructor**?

  In c++,constructor is a special method which is invoked automatically at the time of object creation.It is used to initialize the data members of new object generally.
  
  Default constructor(only shallow copy)
  
  Parameterized constructor
  
  Copy constructor(deep copy)
  
  
  
What is a **Destructor**?

  A destructor works opposite to constructor; it destructs the objects of classes. It can be defined only once in a class. Like constructors, it is invoked automatically.
  
  
  
What is **this** keyword in C++?
  
  It can be used to pass current object as a parameter to another method.
  
  It can be used to refer current class instance variable.
  
  It can be used to declare indexers.

What is **Inheritance**?

  When one object acquires all the behavior and
